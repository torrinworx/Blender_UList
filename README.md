# Blender_UList
Goal: A Blender UIList with Property functionality.

Currently it only adds items to the UIList element, I have no idea how to take Properties and pass their values to an execute function. See this Blender Stack Exchange post for more info: https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/255567/how-to-use-property-definitions-and-propertygroups-with-uilists
